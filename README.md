You will need to define an `env.js` file with the following `const` to get this to work
```javascript
const CUST = ''; // this was to define the subdomain
const CUST_URL = ''; // this was just used for an img link

const SEARCH_URL = ''; // the fetch endpoint
const SEARCH_PARAMS = {}; // fetch body
```
